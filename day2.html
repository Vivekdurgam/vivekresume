<h2> Projects</h2><hr>
<p style="color:darkmagenta">As a Unified Mentor Intern, I actively engaged in a series of impactful data science and machine learning projects, applying robust analytical techniques to real-world datasets. This experience allowed me to hone my skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling, delivering actionable insights and building practical solutions.</p>

<strong><p>My key contributions include:<p></strong>

<strong>Google Play Store Apps Analysis:</strong> Conducted an end-to-end analysis of over 10,000 apps, identifying key market trends, user engagement patterns, and strategic opportunities for app developers. This involved extensive data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and data visualization using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).<br><br>
<strong>Netflix Data:</strong> Cleaning, Analysis, and Visualization: Performed comprehensive data cleaning, analysis, and visualization on a Netflix content dataset. I uncovered significant trends in content distribution, temporal release patterns, and country-specific viewing preferences, providing insights into content strategy.<br><br>
<strong>Olympics Data Analysis Using Machine Learning:</strong> Explored historical Olympic data to analyze medal distribution, identify top-performing athletes and countries, and study gender participation trends. I also developed a foundational machine learning model to predict medal outcomes, showcasing the potential of AI in sports analytics.<br><br>

<strong>Uber Trip Analysis Machine Learning Project: </strong>Analyzed Uber trip data to identify demand patterns and built a predictive model for trip forecasting. This project involved advanced time series decomposition, feature engineering, and ensemble modeling, resulting in a highly accurate prediction model for optimizing resource allocation and dynamic pricing strategies.<br>
